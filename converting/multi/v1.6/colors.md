## Colors

To configure alternative colors just set the `JQ_COLORS`
environment variable to colon-delimited list of partial terminal
escape sequences like `"1;31"`, in this order:

  - color for `null`
  - color for `false`
  - color for `true`
  - color for numbers
  - color for strings
  - color for arrays
  - color for objects

The default color scheme is the same as setting
`"JQ_COLORS=1;30:0;39:0;39:0;39:0;32:1;39:1;39"`.

This is not a manual for VT100/ANSI escapes.  However, each of
these color specifications should consist of two numbers separated
by a semi-colon, where the first number is one of these:

  - 1 (bright)
  - 2 (dim)
  - 4 (underscore)
  - 5 (blink)
  - 7 (reverse)
  - 8 (hidden)

and the second is one of these:

  - 30 (black)
  - 31 (red)
  - 32 (green)
  - 33 (yellow)
  - 34 (blue)
  - 35 (magenta)
  - 36 (cyan)
  - 37 (white)
